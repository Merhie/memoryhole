Screenshots of rendered messages
================================

pull requests welcome!

If you maintain or support an MUA that deals with encrypted mail,
please submit a folder with screenshots of the messages from the
corpus here.

Even if you don't handle these messages completely, having screenshots
that show how they display in your MUA will help other implementors.

Recommended structure for an MUA named foo:

foo/version.txt -- should contain the version that is documented here
foo/A.png -- graphical screenshot of MUA rendering message A 
foo/A.txt -- (for text-mode clients) text dump of MUA rendering message A
 [...]
foo/README.md -- any additional information
